It may take up to 2 hours for these changes to propagate through the system. There are a few things to keep in mind about this system.
-- The DL partition consists of 8 nodes with dual P100 GPUs and 4 nodes with dual V100 GPUs.
-- The GPU partition consists of 24 nodes with four V100 GPUs per node.
-- The system is managed via the Slurm scheduler. You can log into a Carbonate login node and submit jobs to one of the available partitions.
-- The DL partitions are dl (containing 7x P100 nodes and 4x V100 nodes), and dl-debug (containing a P100 node).
-- The GPU partitions are gpu (containing 22x V100 nodes), and gpu-debug (containing two V100 nodes).
-- You will need to specify the required GPU resource for each job using the gpus tag. For example to request 2 GPUs per requested node: #SBATCH --gpus-per-node=2 
-- We have built a suite of Deep Learning software that is available via a system module. These are the significant versions:
deeplearning/2.3.0 has Python 3 and Tensorflow 2.3.0, among other packages 
deeplearning/2.4.1 has Python 3 and Tensorflow 2.4.1, among other packages

For more information on the DL and GPU nodes themselves you can refer to the Knowledge Base article https://kb.iu.edu/d/avjk.
Another article https://kb.iu.edu/d/awrz, contains more information on the Slurm scheduler. If you need help using the Slurm scheduler
please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us at radl@iu.edu.

You can now use the IU HPC Projects website (https://hpcprojects.uits.iu.edu/) to administer projects on high performance computing (HPC)
resources supported by UITS Research Technologies. For example, you can add/remove members from your project. Please see https://kb.iu.edu/d/bgmo for more information.

Please let us know if you see anything on the system that could be improved. We are happy to help get folks up and running on the system.
We are also happy to help with DL application development and optimization, just contact us at {{ help_url }}. Thanks!

Thank you,
