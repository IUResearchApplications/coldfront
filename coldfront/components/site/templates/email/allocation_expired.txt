Dear {{center_name}} user,

Your access to {{center_name}} resources has expired. Any accounts under these RT project(s) and allocation(s) are now unable to
access the associated resource. If you wish to continue using them, the managers responsible for the following project(s) must renew the expired
project(s) and allocation(s). Below is a list of links to your project(s) containing at least one expired allocation: 
{% for project_key, project_url in project_dict.items %}
Project Title: {{project_key}}
Project URL: {{ project_url.0 }}
Project PI: {{ project_url.1 }} 

    {% spaceless %} {% for allocation_key, allocation_value in allocation_dict.items %}{% if allocation_key == project_url.0 %}Expired Allocation(s):{% for allocation in allocation_value %}{% for allocation_url, resource_name in allocation.items %}
        {{ resource_name }}{% endfor %}{% endfor %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}{% endspaceless %}
{% endfor %}
The managers responsible for these projects are required to renew it on a yearly basis. The expired allocations can be renewed during the project renewal.
If they are not they will need to be renewed seperately.
For more information about the yearly renewal, visit our knowledge base: {{ project_renewal_help_url }}.

If you are not the PI or a manager under this project, you are receiving this notice as a courtesy.

If you have any questions please email us at {{ help_email }}

Thank you,
