Dear {{center_name}} user,

Your access to {{center_name}} resources is expiring soon. Failure to renew the expiring RT project and its allocation(s) on time will terminate access to the resource 
for all users in the allocation(s). To renew, login to RT Projects and complete the short renewal process for each expiring project. Below is a list of links to 
your project(s) containing at least one expiring allocation: 
{% for project_key, project_url in project_dict.items %}
Project Title: {{project_key}}
Project URL: {{ project_url.0 }}
Project PI: {{ project_url.1 }}
Project Type: {{ project_url.3 }}
{% if not project_url.2 %}NOTE: This project cannot be renewed. The PI of this project will need to submit a new project.{% endif %}
    {% spaceless %}{% for days_key, days_value in expiration_dict.items %}
    Allocation(s) expiring in {{days_key}} days:{% for allocations in days_value %}{% if allocations.0 == project_url.0 %}  
        {% spaceless %}{{ allocations.2 }}{% endspaceless %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}
        {% endfor %}{% endspaceless %}
{% endfor %}
The managers for these projects are required to renew them unless stated otherwise. The expiring allocations can be renewed during the project renewal.
If they are not they will need to be renewed seperately.
For more information about the yearly renewal, visit our knowledge base: {{ project_renewal_help_url }}

If you are not the PI or a manager under this project, you are receiving this notice as a courtesy.

If you have any questions please email us at {{ help_email }}

Thank you,
