The Quartz system consists of 92 nodes, each with two AMD EPYC 7742 2.25 GHz CPUs and 512 GB of RAM.

The system is managed via the Slurm scheduler. You can log into a Quartz login node and submit jobs to one of the available partitions. The two partitions are general and debug.

For more information about Quartz you can refer to the Knowledge Base article https://kb.iu.edu/d/qrtz.

Another article https://kb.iu.edu/d/awrz, contains more information on the Slurm scheduler. If you need help using the Slurm scheduler please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us at {{ help_url }}.

To use this new account you will need to add this line to your job script:
#SBATCH -A {{ slurm_account_name }}

Interactive jobs will require this:
srun -A {{ slurm_account_name }} <commands>

We are also happy to help with the development and optimization of your workflow, just contact us at {{ help_url }}. Thanks!
