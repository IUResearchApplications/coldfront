Dear {{ center_name }} user,

Your project "{{ project_title }}" on RT Projects expires today. Once expired you will no longer be able to edit your project.

Your allocations will remain active until they expire. Upon expiring anyone within that allocation will lose access to
its resource.

If you still need access to RT's resources you will need to submit a new class project.

If you are not the PI or a manager in this project you are receiving this notice as a courtesy.

If you have any questions please email us at {{ help_email }}

Thank you,
