Dear {{ center_name }} user,

Your project "{{ project_title }}" will expire in {{ expiring_in_days }} day{{ expiring_in_days|pluralize }}. Once
it expires you will no longer be able to edit your project until you submit a project review at this link: {{ project_review_url }} 

You can request allocation renewals in your project review. If you do not renew them your allocations will remain
active until they expire. Upon expiring everyone within that allocation will lose access to its resource.

Only project PIs and managers are able to submit a project review. For more information about project reviews,
visit our knowledge base: {{ project_renewal_help_url }}

If you are a student or collaborator under this project, you are receiving this notice as a courtesy.

If you have any questions please email us at {{ help_email }}

Thank you,
