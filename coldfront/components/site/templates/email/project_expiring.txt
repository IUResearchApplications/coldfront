Dear {{ center_name }} user,

Your project "{{ project_title }}" on RT Projects will expire in {{ expiring_in_days }} day{{ expiring_in_days|pluralize }} along with its allocations.
Once it expires you will no longer be able to edit your project until you submit a project renewal at this link: {{ project_review_url }}

You can request allocation renewals during your project renewal. If you do not renew them during this time you will need to renew them separately.
This can be done from each allocation's detail page. If you do not renew them before they expire everyone within those 
allocations will lose access to their resources.

Only project PIs and managers are able to submit a project renewal. For more information about project renewals,
visit our knowledge base: {{ project_renewal_help_url }}

If you are not the PI or a manager in this project you are receiving this notice as a courtesy.

If you have any questions please email us at {{ help_email }}

Thank you,
