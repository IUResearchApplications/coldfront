Dear {{center_name}} user,

You have been added to an active slate project allocation but you do not have a slate project account.
In order to access your new slate project's storage space you will need to visit https://access.iu.edu/Accounts/Create and create a Slate Project account.
It can take up to an hour for your account to be created.

If you have any questions please contact {{help_email}}.

Thank you,
