Dear System Administrator,

Allocations to your system resources have expired. You should confirm access to these resources has been removed for all users on the allocations.  
Below is a list of the allocations that expired today:

    Expired Allocation(s):{% for project_key, project_url in project_dict.items %}
    {% spaceless %} {% for allocation_key, allocation_value in allocation_dict.items %}{% if allocation_key == project_url.0 %}{% for allocation in allocation_value %}{% for allocation_url, resource_name in allocation.items %}
        {{ resource_name }} : {{ allocation_url }}{% endfor %}{% endfor %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}{% endspaceless %}
{% endfor %}

Thank you,
